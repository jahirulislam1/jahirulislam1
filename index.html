         <H2> <u> Naming of Sundarbans</u> </H2>
        <p>Sundarbans literally means beautiful forest or beautiful woodland in Bengali. Sundarbans may be named after the sundari tree, which grows there in abundance. Other possible explanations are that it may have been named after "sea forest" or "Chandra-Bandhe (Bandhe)" (ancient aborigines). But it is generally assumed that Sundarbans got its name from the beautiful tree.</p>

        <h3><u> Location of Sundarbans </u> </h3>
        <hr>
       <P> Sundarbans is a vast forest located along the Bay of Bengal and is one of the natural wonders of the world. Located in the delta region of the Padma, Meghna and Brahmaputra river basins, this beautiful forest is located in Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Patuakhali and Barguna districts of Bangladesh and West Bengal in India.The two districts of the state are spread across North Twenty-four Parganas and South Twenty-four Parganas.  The Sundarbans is the world's largest intact forest as the largest mangrove forest in the coastal saline environment.  Spread over 10,000 square kilometers, Sundarbans has an area of ​​6,017 square kilometers (62 %) is in Bangladesh and the rest (38%) is in India.</p>

<h3><u>Plant diversity</u></h3>

<hr>

<p>Major forest species of Sundarbans include abundant sundari, gewa, jhamti garan and keora. According to Prain's calculations published in 1903, there are a total of 245 genera and 334 species of plants.</p>

<p>Mangrove forests in Bangladesh differ greatly in plant life cycle compared to other non-deltavian coastal mangrove forests and upland forests. Variations in plant life cycle of the former have been explained based on the effects of fresh water and low salinity in the northeast, and drainage and sediment accumulation.</p>

<p>The Sundarbans are classified as a humid tropical forest with well-established beach keora (Sonneratia apetala) and other littoral tree dominant forests. Historically the Sundarbans have had three major vegetation types that have been characterized based on the degree of salinity in the water, the degree of freshwater inflow and the depth of relationship with the topography.</p>

<p>Sundari and Gewa predominate throughout the region, along with scattered Dhundal and Keora. Among the <a href="https://bn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A6%98%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8"> grass</a> and bushes, there are sedges, reeds, and leaves neatly arranged. Keora refers to the newly formed alluvial land and this species is important for wildlife, especially the Chitra deer.</p>

<h3><U>animal diversity</U></h3>
<hr>
<p>Sundarbans has a wide animal diversity. Biodiversity conservation management is limited to banning hunting in certain areas of the Sundarbans, such as sanctuaries, where forest resources cannot be harvested unconditionally and wildlife life is minimally disturbed. Although it is clear that Bangladesh's fauna has declined in recent times[15] and so has the Sundarbans Not beyond that. Still Sundarbans sustains many animal species and their related species. Among them, tigers and tigers are being prioritized for biodiversity conservation management and tourism development. The status and conservation management of these two are completely opposite environments under threat Strong indicators of biodiversity and conservation management. As of 2004, Sundarbans is home to 500 Royal Bengal Tigers, the single largest population of tigers in the world.</p>

<p>The ecology of the Sundarbans is fundamental in nature and is home to a large number of wild animals. Human resource harvesting and forest management have many impacts on wildlife populations and habitats. Tortoise (Keto Tortoise Betagur baska, Sundi Tortoise Lissemys punctata and Dhum Cartilaginous Tortoise, Chameleon (Yellow monitor Varanus flavescens and Gui snake Varanus salvator), Python and Royal Bengal Tiger One of the endemic species of Sundarbans.</p>

</p>Recent studies have shown that the Sundarbans of Bangladesh, a rich biodiversity reservoir, are home to 120 species of commercially important fish, 270 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 35 reptiles and 8 amphibian species. This suggests that a large proportion of different species exist in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh (eg 30 per cent Reptiles, 37 percent of birds and 37 percent of mammals) and a large proportion of them are rare in other parts of the country.[22] According to the government, 2 species of amphibians, 14 species of reptiles, 25 species of birds and 5 species of mammals are currently threatened.</p>

<p>Sundarbans is a paradise for ornithologists in terms of bird watching, study and research. [23] Many animals have already become extinct including wild buffalo, fallow deer, wild bull, small and large one horned rhinoceros, bar horn, leopard. Various birds including the white-billed pair-eared shrike, the common duck, the common wagtail, and the water pheasant have also disappeared.</p>

<h3><U>Sundarban tiger</U></h3>

<hr>
<p>According to a 2004 estimate, the Sundarbans are home to about 500 Royal Bengal tigers, the single largest tiger population[20]. These tigers are widely known for killing significant numbers of people, on average around 100 to 250 per year. They are not the only tigers that live close to the borders of human habitation. Surrounded by tiger sanctuary In Bandhavgarh, such attacks on people are rare. Due to various security measures, not a single death has been reported in the Indian part of the Sundarbans. On the other hand, in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh, from 1981 to 2004, more than fifty tigers have died at the hands of humans.</p>
